## Hi there

- 👋 I’m Mike Jenkins (@JenkinsMike)!
- 👀 I’m interested in continuous improvement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Appian and...
- 🔭 I’m currently working on light-studying for the certification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything! But first, iSeatz Slack reactions.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at Jenkins.Mike@gmail.com.  You could also try a carrier pidgeon to Orlando.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have Aphantasia. I do not have the ability to "close my eyes and picture an anything. My ability to recall things visually is based on memory and event memory, but I cannot "see it".
- 💻 Pro Tip: We all know that iTerm is better than Terminal. Now, you will know, as I do, that [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is better still!
   - [Download](https://app.warp.dev/get_warp?package=dmg) for Mac it and give it a try!
